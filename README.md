# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
In order for me to increase my abilities as a programmer and expand my employment opportunities and capabilities, I am expanding my knowledge base and learning new languages that I haven't worked with before. 


{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Java language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
The text editor that I developed this software with was Visual Studios Code, after installing the Java Development Kit (JDK).

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
I used Java as the programming language, and the libraries I included were java.util.Scanner for input functionality and java.util.ArrayList to enable a dynamic array for storage in the Numbers game.
