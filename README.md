# Overview

In order for me to increase my abilities as a programmer and expand my employment opportunities and capabilities, I am expanding my knowledge base and learning new languages that I haven't worked with before. This will show how quickly I am able to develop new programs in languages that I am unfamiliar with and how quickly I can adapt.

I created a Games Library program, where the goal was to create a library of games that the user can play. As of yet, I was only able to make a single game, but it was enough for me to understand and demonstrate my understanding of how to store variables, accept input from a user, the differences between the == comparator and the obj.equals() method, and the use of certain libraries.



My purpose for writing this software was to demonstrate what I learned about the Java language in the short time I studied it.

# Development Environment

The text editor that I developed this software with was Visual Studios Code, after installing the Java Development Kit (JDK).

I used Java as the programming language, and the libraries I included were java.util.Scanner for input functionality and java.util.ArrayList to enable a dynamic array for storage in the Numbers game.

# Future Work


- Program more games and add them to the library, such as Hangman, Hilo, and Black Jack.
- Add more error handling to increase program robustness, so people can continually play despite entering improper inputs.
